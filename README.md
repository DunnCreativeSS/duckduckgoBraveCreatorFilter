If you found this repo useful, consider clicking the sponsor button near the top :) Sponsoring via GitHub is as little as $1/month and if you do not use banks or credit cards, there are crypto links included :)<br /><br />
Haha I tried my best to get this to work. Turns out there's a limit to how long a url address can be, so appending 17mb worth of text didn't really work out all that well :P


But, I tried!


The premise still works for the DDG team to implement this if they wanna.


Download this git repository somewhere local as a .zip


https://github.com/DunnCreativeSS/duckduckgoBraveCreatorFilter


Unpack it


In Brave, go to url chrome://extensions


Turn Developer mode on in the top-right


Click 'Load unpacked'


Go to directory where Zip was unpacked


open directory


now, search for something on duckduckgo


voila!


when you don't want to use the brave filter, simply disable the extension


This uses a flat file in the github repo, and won't update with new publishers a/o today. If the team wants to do this they'd probably want to set up a jquery $.get on a publisher file somewhere on the internet on first run and every so often, but that's killer with a slower internet connection.. but if they reduced it to just websites it'd be far less data... my issue with the hosted file was CORS and I ain't messing with that ;)
